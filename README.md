# Dataset
> The dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays from 1987 to 2008. I gathered & analyze data for three years (2006, 2007 & 2008).  The total number of  observations are 16,984,354  and the following questions will be addressed:-

- what are the worst airports/states in terms of delayed and cancelled flights?
 - what are the worst flights in terms of delayed and cancelled flighes?
- what carrier is mostly used? 
- Best day of the week to travel ?
- what year encountered  high number of cancellation in flights

# Summary
The Dataset which includes 3 years from 2006-2008, had 4 months observation in 2008. Despite the few months recorded in 2008, it had the highest cancellation cause when compared to 2007 and 2006. Carrier and Weather were the leading cancellation cause and Delay that affected flights. I went further to investigate the carriers using unique carriers and i discovered SouthEast was the most used carrier and had the highest depature delayed time while America Eagle had the highest cancellation cause even it was fourth most used carrier. Most delay caused by weather was between 0- 15 mins.  Saturday was the best days for flights with average time between 1-2pm  because it had lower delayed cause due lower usage. Sunday had the highest delay recorded with average time between 3pm -4pm, Thursday had the lowest cancellation cause between 12:30 - 1pm.  ORD was the destination of flight with highest delay and cancellation while ATL as destination recorded the highest number of flights.
# Key Insight

>  Since weather cause is unavoidable, carrier such as SouthEast should work on the delay in depature because it is the most used flight, while America Eagle should work on flight cancellation.
